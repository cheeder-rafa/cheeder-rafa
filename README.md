## Hello there

I'll introduce myself shortly so you can get to know me better

## Public information

My name is Rafael Ribeiro. Currently studying Computer Science and working as a Front-end Developer at EJCM, a Junior Company at the University.

I discovered programming when I was around 15 years old, when my favorite game ended its activities and I decided to help friends with the creation of a new server. Although I barely understood what a line of code was, the feeling of creating something stayed with me, and years later I started to study about it.

## Detailed information

* **Name**: Rafael Ribeiro
* **Age**: 24
* **Living in**: Mendes - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
* **Stack**: JavaScript - React/Native - SQL - Node.js (Express)
* **University**: Federal University of Rio de Janeiro

## Curiosities about me

* K-Pop made me want to learn Korean (I studied for a few months) and now I'm addicted to drama series;
* My first contact with programming was almost 10 years ago with Java due to the MapleStory game, which I still love and play today;
* I've also worked as a commercial advisor, negotiating projects at EJCM;
* I've already helped and moderated three private MapleStory servers and created two of Dofus (I had no idea what I was doing);
* Photography is my passion. My instagram is exclusively for this practice;
* Iceland is my favorite country
